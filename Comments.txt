General Comments:
  - I don't like the output of your main code. It is not very readable and does not value your test.
  - Why one should not employ the optmized version of the code?
  - Don't leave block of commented codes. Make a main in a different folder to perform other tests.

=== I tried to uncomment the part with A*B but it didn't compile. I am not going to debug it
